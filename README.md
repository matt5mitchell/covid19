# COVID-19 Forecasting Tool
To give myself a much-needed sense of control early in the COVID-19 pandemic, I created multiple analytical tools to forecast the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. 
The tools gathered the latest data, estimated the effective reproductive rate, and used that information to forecast the epidemic using compartmental models.

v1 - Simple SIR model
v2 - Simple SIR model presented in an Rshiny app (with other data reporting features)
v3 - SSEIR model that estimated the effect of social distancing using an optimizer to fit historical data

As the world settled into the long COVID-19 slog, these tools became less useful and were retired.
